# ARKANGEL AI Challenge

##Description

The implemented model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically chosen for its effectiveness in image-based tasks, such as emotion recognition. This CNN architecture is designed to capture relevant spatial features from images. The model was employed using Google Colab as the environment and Python, along with the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. The dataset used for training and validation was the [Face expression recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/) sourced from Kaggle. This dataset exclusively consists of 48x48 grayscale images.

##Files

The provided files consist of  a Jupyter notebook where the solution was implemented named "ArkangelAI_Technical_Test," a notebook featuring a brief tutorial on how to use the model named "Demo," and the model itself named "AiModel."
